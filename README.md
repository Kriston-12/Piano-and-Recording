# Piano-and-Recording
The music maker lets you record songs! Notes are input using a PS2 keypad and saved to off-chip memory, all with a nice VGA display. Songs can be played back at the userâ€™s request; users can even let other users play their songs. 

The video is about how our piano works. It is of low resolution since the max size of a video is 10MB
